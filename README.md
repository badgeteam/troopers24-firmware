## How to build the firmware

Downloading the source code, installing the SDK and building the firmware can be done using the following commands:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/badgeteam/mch2022-firmware-esp32
cd mch2022-firmware-esp32
make prepare
make build
```

## How to flash and start the monitor

Flashing the firmware to a device and starting the debug monitor can be done using the following commands:

```sh
make flash
make monitor
```

## Linux permissions
Create `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-mch2022.rules` with the following contents:

```
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="16d0", ATTR{idProduct}=="0f9a", MODE="0666"
```

Then run the following commands to apply the new rule:

```
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

### Ubuntu snap
While we have no idea why Canonical thinks breaking things by forcing Ubuntu users to use a bad software distribution system, we do have a solution!

Install the Chromium snap package, then run the following command (in addition to adding the udev rule above). If you already have the badge connected turn it off and back on after running the command.

```
sudo snap connect chromium:raw-usb
```
